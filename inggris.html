  <h2 align="center">CARDBOARD WASTE</h2>
  
  <p>
    <br>
    Waste is the waste generated from a production process, whether industrial or domestic (household). It can be concluded that waste is leftover or used goods that are considered worthless and no longer used. This time, I will explain about used cardboard packaging waste that is reprocessed into a simple analog wall clock using a used clock movement.
    </br>
    <br>
   Cardboard waste is solid waste resulting from the use or production of cardboard. Cardboard waste is inorganic waste that can reduce tree felling, create business opportunities, and create jobs. Used cardboard can be used in creative industries, such as crafts and furniture.
   </br>
   <br>
  The main materials used are used cardboard, clock movements (from broken clocks or purchased separately), and clock hands. Supporting materials include glue, scissors/cutters, rulers, markers, paint/dyes, and additional decorations. The tools used include a ruler, a brush, a glue gun, and pins for punching holes in the cardboard.
  </br>
  <br>
   The manufacturing process is as follows: Select used cardboard that is still thick and sturdy. Draw a clock pattern to the desired size. Cut the cardboard to fit the pattern with a cutter/scissors to ensure neatness. The numbers 1–12 can be made from colored paper or written directly with a marker. A small hole is made in the center of the cardboard. The clock movement is then attached to the back, and the hands are attached to the front. The cardboard surface is decorated to enhance its appeal. The cardboard wall clock is ready to use or display as a decoration.
   </br>
   <br>
   The benefits of using used cardboard include reducing the accumulation of cardboard waste. This product can be sold as a unique craft at an affordable price, fostering handicraft skills and artistic ideas, and serving as a learning tool for students about waste recycling. Observations have shown that cardboard waste can be processed into a functional wall clock. The manufacturing process is simple and inexpensive. Furthermore, this activity fosters awareness of the importance of recycling, enhances creativity, and provides added value both aesthetically and economically.

    Waste is any leftover or unused material resulting from a production process or human activity. Waste has the potential to harm the environment and health if not managed properly. Waste can be in solid form, such as cardboard, plastic, and glass; liquid waste, such as oil, grease, and laundry detergent; and gaseous waste, such as vehicle exhaust and factory smoke. In this observation, I will examine cardboard waste.
    </br>
    <br>
    Cardboard waste is the remains of unused cardboard resulting from human activities. If not managed properly, it can cause environmental pollution. This waste is classified as solid waste and is classified as inorganic waste.
    </br>
    <br>
   Cardboard is a material made from paper pulp and wood fiber. Cardboard has a corrugated layer that makes it strong yet lightweight and easy to shape. Cardboard is generally shaped like a block or cube. Cardboard is typically used for packaging or as a storage container. Cardboard is generally brown in color due to its high paper content.
   </br>
   <br>
  Cardboard waste is a type of solid waste that still has high utility value. If managed properly through the recycling process, cardboard waste can provide economic benefits and help preserve the environment. Therefore, public awareness to reuse used cardboard needs to be increased so that the amount of waste can be reduced and the environment becomes cleaner.

    Waste is a material or residual product from human activities that can pollute the environment and requires proper management. Waste can be solid, liquid, or gaseous. Effective waste management is crucial for protecting the environment and health. This time, I will report on the results of my research on one type of waste: cardboard waste.
    </br>
    <br>
   Cardboard waste can come from various sources, such as supermarkets and private homes. Typically, cardboard waste is generated from manufactured products like instant noodles, packaged drinks, or other household items. Meanwhile, cardboard is produced independently based on consumer choices. These cardboard boxes are usually used for online sales.
   </br>
   <br>
   Cardboard boxes come in various shapes and types, from thin and small to thick and large. These boxes are generally made of thick paper and have a sturdy structure. However, after use, these boxes can become waste that fills up landfills.
   </br>
   <br>
  To address this impact, we can recycle cardboard into reusable items. With a little creativity, we can create beautiful and useful items. We can look for references from various sources such as the internet, magazines, or newspapers.
